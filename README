## A Graph-based Approach for Keyword Identification ##

This code finds the most salient words in documents through the Pagerank algorithm. 
There are 2 sets of data in the example data set: positive and negative. 
One can change the number of iterations and the number of highest words from the main(). 


# STOPWORDS 

Before running the code, make sure that you have the nltk data of "stopwords".
If you don't have, run this on Python console: 
	>>> import nltk
	>>> nltk.download("stopwords")
